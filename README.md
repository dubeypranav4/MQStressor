# QueueBenchMaster

## Overview

QueueBenchMaster is a modular and extensible framework designed for benchmarking and stress-testing various message queue technologies. Built on Elixir/Erlang for optimal parallelism and load generation, this framework aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance metrics like latency, throughput, CPU usage, and memory consumption. Dockerized for ease of setup and execution.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily plug in different message queue implementations.
- **Metrics Collection**: Evaluate latency, throughput, CPU, and memory usage.
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Simulate practical message patterns and workloads.
- **Extensibility**: Define custom test cases and scenarios.
- **Automated Analysis**: Get automated result analysis and recommendations.
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Scale tests across multiple nodes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Elixir/Erlang runtime
